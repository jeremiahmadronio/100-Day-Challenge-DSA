## 10. Minimum Window Substring (Hard)
**Problem:**  
Find the smallest substring in `s` that contains all characters of `t`.  

**Instructions:**  
- Use **two HashMaps**: one for `t` frequency, one for current window.  
- Use **sliding window** to expand and contract.  
- Track minimum length substring that satisfies condition.  

**Examples:**  
- Input: `s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"` → Output: `"BANC"`  
- Input: `s = "a", t = "a"` → Output: `"a"`  
- Input: `s = "a", t = "aa"` → Output: `""` (not possible)
