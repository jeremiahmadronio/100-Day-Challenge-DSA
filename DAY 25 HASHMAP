## 5. Happy Number
**Problem:**  
A number is "happy" if repeatedly replacing it with the sum of squares of digits eventually leads to `1`. Use a **HashSet** to detect loops.  

**Instructions:**  
- Keep calculating sum of squares of digits.  
- If you reach `1`, return true.  
- If a number repeats (cycle detected), return false.  

**Examples:**  
- Input: `19` → Output: `true`  
- Input: `2` → Output: `false`  
- Input: `7` → Output: `true`
