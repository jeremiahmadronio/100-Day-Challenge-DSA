## 1. Count Frequency of Elements
**Problem:**  
Given an array of integers, count how many times each number appears.  

**Instructions:**  
- Use a **HashMap** to store elements as keys and their counts as values.  
- Traverse the array and update counts.  

**Examples:**  
- Input: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 1]` → Output: `{1=2, 2=2, 3=1}`  
- Input: `[5, 5, 5, 6]` → Output: `{5=3, 6=1}`  
- Input: `[7]` → Output: `{7=1}`
