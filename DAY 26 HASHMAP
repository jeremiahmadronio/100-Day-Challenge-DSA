## 6. Isomorphic Strings
**Problem:**  
Two strings are isomorphic if characters in one can be replaced consistently to form the other.  

**Instructions:**  
- Use **two HashMaps**:  
  - One to map characters from string `s` → `t`.  
  - Another to map characters from string `t` → `s`.  
- Ensure mapping is consistent both ways.  

**Examples:**  
- Input: `s = "egg", t = "add"` → Output: `true`  
- Input: `s = "foo", t = "bar"` → Output: `false`  
- Input: `s = "paper", t = "title"` → Output: `true`
